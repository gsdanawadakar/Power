# Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard - Predicting Employee Attrition using Power BI And Integrating with Azure Devops

**Problem Statement:**

Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs, loss of talent, and disruption in workflow. The lack of data-driven insights makes it challenging for HR teams to proactively address attrition risks. The organization needs a solution that leverages HR analytics and predictive modeling to forecast employee attrition and provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing key HR metrics.

**Objectives:**
1. Develop a predictive model to forecast employee attrition based on historical HR data.
2. Create an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to visualize HR metrics and insights.
3. Implement version control and collaborative development using Azure DevOps to ensure effective project management.

**Key Components:**
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:** Gather and clean relevant HR data, including employee demographics, performance metrics, satisfaction surveys, and historical attrition records.

2. **Predictive Model Development:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can forecast employee attrition rates based on historical data.

3. **Power BI Dashboard Creation:** Design and develop an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to display key HR metrics, trends, and insights.

4. **Integration with Azure DevOps:** Set up repositories and implement version control using Azure DevOps to manage the project's source code, documentation, and development resources.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. **Accurate Attrition Predictions:** The predictive model will provide accurate forecasts of potential employee attrition, enabling HR teams to take proactive measures to retain top talent.

2. **Insightful HR Analytics Dashboard:** The Power BI dashboard will offer visualizations of key HR metrics, providing valuable insights into employee demographics, performance trends, and attrition factors.

3. **Streamlined Development Process:** Integration with Azure DevOps will facilitate collaboration and version control, ensuring efficient development and project management.

4. **Data-Driven Decision-making:** The combination of predictive modeling and the interactive dashboard will empower HR professionals to make informed decisions regarding talent management and employee retention strategies.

5. **Cost Savings:** By predicting and preventing attrition, the organization can save costs associated with recruitment, onboarding, and training, leading to improved overall financial performance.

6. **Improved Employee Engagement:** Implementing data-driven strategies to address attrition risks can lead to improved employee engagement and job satisfaction, fostering a positive work environment.

Overall, the project aims to equip the organization with powerful HR analytics capabilities, leading to better talent management practices, reduced employee turnover, and enhanced business performance.
